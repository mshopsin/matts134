Our small but growing team prides itself on being more than just code-pushing developers- creativity is more than half the battle here. So our dev test is pretty open-ended:

Write an app that consumes data from an external source and is music related.

For inspiration, here are some APIs you could use:

the echonest: http://developer.echonest.com/ last.fm: http://www.last.fm/api songkick: http://www.songkick.com/developer/

Bonus points for any of the following:

make the app universal write some unit or functional tests for the app (we are using square's KIF in-house: http://github.com/square/KIF/) use some iOS 5 or 6-specific technologies (Twitter / Social frameworks, UICollectViews...) We don't expect you to be a designer as well (we have some pretty amazing designers on our team), but a well-thought-out UI is important.

When you're ready, push the app to the github repo we've created for you.

Good luck!
